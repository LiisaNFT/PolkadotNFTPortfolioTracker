# This query, named `PortfolioByUser`, retrieves either the NFTs owned by a user, a list of collections, or both, 
# based on the specified blockchain chain (`$chain`) and the desired response type (`$responseType`).
# To get only the NFTs owned by the user, set $responseType to OWNED_TOKENS.
# To get only the list of collections, set $responseType to COLLECTIONS.
# To get both, set $responseType to BOTH. Always specify the desired blockchain chain using the `$chain` parameter.

# This GraphQL query retrieves the sale event with the lowest sale price 
# for NFTs within a specified collection and time interval. 
# It filters sale events by the given collection ID and ensures that 
# the event timestamp is between the provided start and end times.
# The results are sorted by sale price in ascending order, 
# and only the sale event with the lowest price is returned.

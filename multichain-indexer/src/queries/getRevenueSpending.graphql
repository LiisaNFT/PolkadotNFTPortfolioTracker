# This GraphQL query retrieves sales statistics for a specified wallet address and chain, focusing on two main activities: purchases (where the wallet was the buyer) and sales (where the wallet was the seller). For each activity, the query fetches the price of the NFT sale event. Additionally, by leveraging an optional parameter named breakdownByCollection, the query can provide a detailed breakdown of sales by collection. If this parameter is set to true, the response will include the specific collection details (such as its ID and name) for each sale event. If set to false, the query will only return the aggregate sales data without the collection specifics. This design allows users to dynamically choose between a summarized view or a collection-wise detailed breakdown, catering to different data analysis needs.

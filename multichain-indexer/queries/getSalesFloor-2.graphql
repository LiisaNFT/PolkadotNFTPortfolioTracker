# This GraphQL query retrieves the sale event with the lowest sale price 
# for NFTs within a specified collection, time interval, and blockchain chain.
# It filters sale events by the given collection ID, ensures the event timestamp 
# is between the provided start and end times, and that it occurred on the specified blockchain.
# The results are sorted by sale price in ascending order, and only the sale event with the 
# lowest price is returned.
